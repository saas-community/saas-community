# SaaS - Software as a service
## Learning to build SaaS. Together.

Welcome to the public landing page for the <a href="https://launchpass.com/all-about-saas">SaaS Slack group</a>. 
Our community is a space to discuss problems and share learnings about building SaaS companies and products.
This would help accelerate the pace of building  more successful saas companies. We have founders and senior
leaders from stellar startups and established enterprise companies sharing their experience and helping 
others.

We think of SaaS as enterprise software, delivered as a service, 
targeted at other enterprise companies as customers and users.
